# Diabetic Prediction with Streamlit

## Overview

This project is a web-based application for predicting the risk of diabetes using machine learning. It leverages a predictive model that takes various health-related features as input and provides a binary prediction (diabetic or non-diabetic). The user interface is built with Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers an easy-to-use interface where users can input their health information.

- **Prediction**: After entering the required information, the application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether the user is at risk for diabetes.

- **Interpretability**: The application provides explanations for the prediction, highlighting the most influential features in making the prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-prediction-streamlit.git
   cd diabetic-prediction-streamlit
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Model Training

The predictive model was trained using dataset which is also provided in this repo itself and SVM algorithm is used in this project .
